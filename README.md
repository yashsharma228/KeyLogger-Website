# KeyLogger

A simple web-based keylogger that logs keypress events. This is for learning purposes only.

Usage : 
1. Open index.html in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Start Logging Keypresses" button to start logging keystrokes.
3. Click on the "Stop Logging Keypresses" button to stop logging keystrokes.
4. The keypresses and their states will be displayed in the log and state divs.

Files :
1. index.html : The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the webpage.
2. style.css : The CSS file that styles the webpage.
3. index.js : The JavaScript file that handles the keypress events and updates the log and state divs.
